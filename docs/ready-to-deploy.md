title: Ready to Deploy?

You should have an `applications.json` file with your defined applications and extensions. If you don't, you can head on over to the **[Getting Started](../getting-started)** tutorial to create one.

Before deploying your application to Domino you may want to, first, test it locally in your browser. The Verse Developer Extension API allows us to make this possible, using Chrome or Firefox. Follow along in the **[Loading an Application for Development](../development)** docs to get started.

Otherwise, you are ready to deploy your Verse application(s) for production use. The **[Domino Server Deployment](../domino-server-deployment)** docs will have your applications running for all Verse users in no time!

:::note
*In either case, be sure to follow the **[Secure Deployment Practices](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/Verse-Extension-Documentation/docs/best-security-practices/)** documentation to mitigate any potential vulnerabilities your application may have introduced.*
